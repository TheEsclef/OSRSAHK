# OSRSAHK
A bunch of osrs AHK scripts I wrote

BEFORE RUNNING MAKE SURE YOU'RE RUNNING OSRS WITH FIXED CLASSIC AND SMALLEST WINDOW SIZE YOU CAN.
MOST OF THESE SCRIPTS HAVE CERTAIN CRITERIAS WHERE YOU HAVE TO STAND AND LOOK, I'M TOO LAZY TO ADD THE COMMENTS CURRENTLY BUT WILL DO IN THE FUTURE.

These scripts aren't meant to be used by people, they act as simple frameworks for you to base your own stuff off of. Take inspiration or just modify them to your needs!
